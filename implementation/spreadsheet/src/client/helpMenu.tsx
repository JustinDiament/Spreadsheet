                    <li>
                        Click on a cell to edit it
                    </li>
                        
                    <li>
                        Click on a cell, Hold shift, then click on another cell to select all cells in that range
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                If no cell is selected to start, the first cell you click on after pressing shift will be the first cell in the range
                            </li>

                            <li>
                                While holding shift, anytime you click on a cell it will set that cell as the last one of the range, but will keep the first cell the same
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <li>
                        To reference the value of another cell, type REF(##), where the ## is the column and row of the cell being referenced (i.e. REF(A1) or REF(BB7))
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        To do arithmetic in a cell, simply write the expression you want to evaluate
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Ex. 1+2*3^2 will display 19, but the entered value will stay the same and be editable
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        To concatenate two strings, type string+string (i.e. good+bye will display goodbye)
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Placing spaces around the plus sign will put spaces in the displayed result
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                The entered value will stay the same and be editable
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        To calculate the sum or average of a range of cells, type SUM(##..##) or AVERAGE(##..##) where the ## is the column and row of the cell being referenced
                    </li>
                </ul>

                            <li>
                                You will be allowed to create contradicting rules, however entering any value in a cell with contradicting rules will show an error

                    <li>
                        To style the text inside a cell, select the cell you want to style and click on the styling options you'd like in the top-right corner
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        If you want to style multiple cells at once, just multi-select the range you want to style and click on the styling options

                    <li>
                        For the bold, italic, and underline style toggles, if every selected cell has the given style value already, it will un-apply the style. Otherwise, it will apply the style to all the selected cells, regardless of whether they were already set to that style

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                e.g. If all selected cells are bolded, clicking bold will un-bold all the selected cells. If some or none of the selected cells are bolded, clicking bold will bold all the selected cells

                    <li>
                        For the text color picker, simply drag the picker to the color you want or type the hex code you want in the input box. Any invalid inputs will reset the color to the default black
